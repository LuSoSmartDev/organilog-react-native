Will it be possible to edit the value of "v2.1" sent on the API, for each new app version ?

- do not modify anything on the current way the app works with such multi-users interventions.
- on left sidebar of mobile app, add a link called "Interventions not assigned" (French : "Interventions non assignées"). To display every Intervention with "`fk_user_id = 0`". Adapt API to receive these interventions.
- This menu will display a similar interface of the current daily list of interventions. But, when they open any of these interventions, it will have a big button called : "Assigned to me" (French : "Me l'assigner"). If a worker click on this button, the intervention will become visible on his daily list : and `fk_user_id = CURRENT_USER_ID`.

- only the first one can assigned to himself. When this user synchronize, we can use 'intervention_meta' to define keyname 'already_assigned' to '1'.
- when it's assigned, it should disappear from other mobile phone. So, other phone should check 'intervention_meta' to check if not assigned interventions, are now assigned or not.
- if someone else assigned to himself few seconds after. When this worker try to synchronize, the system can told him : "Oups, this intervention was already assigned to someone else." (French : "Oups, une intervention a déjà été assignée à un autre intervenant.").

the worker should not be able to edit, take photo or signature, on this interface.
They should assigned an intervention first, to be able to edit data, take photo ...

When user press on "Me l'assigner" (means "Assigned to me"), it should :

- try to send data to specific API.

- The API will return data, to know if it's ok, or already assigned. Then application can display a message :
"Intervention assignée avec succès" (means : "Intervention properly assigned to you")
"Intervention déjà assignée" (means : "Intervention was already assigned")
"Aucune connexion, ré-essayer plus tard" (means : "No connexion, please try again later")

- After API return value, the app will return to "Intervention not assigned list" (page). And it may have 2 possibility to display an animation :
animation 1/ intervention selected become red (on the list) and disappear (if intervention was already assigned, to remove it from the list)
animation 2/ intervention selected become green (on the list) and disappear (if intervention was properly assigned, because, this intervention will be displayed on "daily list of intervention" page.

I just understand the "white empty intervention" !
I was like : :surprise: !! (ahah)

I will explain, from an example :
Step 1 : manager "John" add an intervention to "Tony"
Step 2 : Tony receive the intervention on the mobile app. (because Tony receive all intervention link to his name, from API)
Step 3 : few minute after, manager "John" edit this intervention and assigned to "Mickael" instead.
Step 4 : Mickael receive it on his mobile app.
But, if nothing is done, Tony will not be able to know this intervention is not for him anymore. Because, the API all send him interventions with int_fk_user_id = ID.

So, I have made something specific inside "intervention_meta" table.
I store, everytime a manager edit the user assigned to an intervention. It store the old user, and the new one.
Then, on the API, I give to Tony, the list of intervention not assigned to him anymore !

With this code (real live example) : `"1508849775":[{"i":"int","v":{"1":199067,"10":0,"28":"2017-10-24 14:56:15"}}]`
It's basic, there is no need to send customerID, adresseID, date ...
It only give "10" (enable/disable field), with value = "0" (it means : deleted, so it need to be remove/hiden on the mobile app).

That was the reason of the white intervention on mobile phone :sourire:
Please, could you check to hide such intervention if "is_actif" (keyname on API : 10) field is equal to "0".
Thanks a lot.

Hey, good news, I have setup a new API to assigned an intervention to the mobile user :
http://test.organilog.com/script/api/set-intervention-assignation.php?user_name=pierreclaude&password=pierreclaude2&intervention_id=232838

Here is a list of intervention not assigned, for your tests :
233441
233442
...
233447
233448

http://adalgo201801181322.organilog.com/script/api/get-sync.php?user_name=tony&password=vijuri95&api_version=8&last_synchro=0
this is a new account just for this example
You can try to login on mobile app with :
account : adalgo201801181322
